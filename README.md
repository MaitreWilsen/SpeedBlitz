Desc      : SpeedBlitz is the best solution to quick reflexes and more. Fast decisions typically mean more mistakesâ€”this efficient training regimen induces a general speeding of               perceptual reaction times without decreased performance accuracy.The user will try to destroy falling targets and the system will keep track of his/her score and                   health. Will utilize the SFML library.
